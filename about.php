  <p>A Little About Me... My name is Doreen Jones; my friends and family call me Dodi. I am a homegrown Washingtonian and this is my third quarter, here, at Seattle Central College on the Web Design track.</p>

<p>Growing up, I have always had a passion and natural knack for design. Given the challenging job market and the non-stop, exponential growth of information technology, I figured tailoring my skills in design for the web would be the perfect route, for not only job security, but for also creating a career path that I can be passionate about and have fun with!</p>

<p>Beside design, I'm a true lover of simple things: fishing, family, bike riding, dancing, cooking and good films. I'm looking forward to learning a lot this quarter in Web 130 - Web Authoring III!</p>
